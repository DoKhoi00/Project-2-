# Project-2- 
This is my project 2 looking at the differences in amino acid sequences and 3D protein structure.
The txt files are the fasta files & the .gz files are the PDB structure files.
The two pdf files are the results from the msaprettyprint and the multiple sequence alignments which both show the tumor suppressor genes sequences alignment and their consensus regions
